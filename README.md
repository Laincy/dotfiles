# Laincy's Dotfiles

Just a simple NixOs setup meant primarily for development and general use. Meant to be kept clean, typically I keep dev dependencies in a project specific flake to reduce clutter and conflicts. If you're going to use this on your own, I'd suggest large amounts of refactoring to the ./nix/ folder as this is where all of my device specific configurations are, other than that it may just require rescaling of things depending on your screen's resolution.
